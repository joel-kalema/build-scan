# Build Scan™ quickstart

This is an example project that you can use to experience the [Build Scan™ service of Gradle Enterprise][gradle.com].

It is a small Java project that has the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle Plugin][manual] already applied.

## Create a Build Scan™

Follow these simple steps to create and publish a Build Scan™ on [scans.gradle.com][scans.gradle.com]:

1. Clone this project
1. Run `./gradlew build --scan`
1. Agree to the [Terms of Service][terms-of-service] on the command line

The build should end with something similar to:

    Publishing build scan...
    https://gradle.com/s/ria2s2x5oaazq

Follow the green link shown at the end of the build to view your Build Scan™ on [scans.gradle.com][scans.gradle.com].

Note: If you run a build without the `--scan` flag, no Build Scan™ will be created and
no information will be sent.

## Experiment with Build Scans

Create different kinds of Build Scans by locally modifying this quickstart project. Here are some ideas:

- Edit `src/main/java/example/Example.java` to introduce compile errors
- Edit `src/test/java/example/ExampleTest.java` to introduce test failures
- Add more dependencies, more plugins, and more projects

Alternatively, enable one of your own builds to produce Build Scans by following the [step-by-step instructions][scans.gradle.com].

## Learn more
